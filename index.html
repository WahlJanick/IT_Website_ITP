			<h3>About the IT-department</h3>
			<p>The IT-Department of the HTL Waidhofen/Ybbs is a rather new department. So new in fact that 2025 was the first year where the first students of the IT-department graduated - the first IT-matura. The department was created in 2020, during the corona pandemic. Since then, many things have happened. Such as countless projects, tests and also fun activities like excursions or trips.</p>
